# Angular Data Tables for jQuery DataTables Developers

An Angular Data Tables example for Developers (like myself) that have used jQuery DataTables for years.

Currently very much a work in progress, what little works is at [https://angulardatatables.benfrog.net/](https://angulardatatables.benfrog.net/)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.6.
